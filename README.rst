Original C code <https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/algorist/book/programs/>

Features:

1. Translated original C programs in procedural language style into Object Oriented fashion. Remove all global variables.
2. Converted original test cases, included in test-script, into set of nosetests.
3. Implemented generic Graph data structure to cover unweighted, weights, flow graph instances. Removed code duplication in original C implementation.
